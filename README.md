## How to create own test project using starter
1. Login to Github: http://github.com. (Create a new account before if you don't have any)
1. Generate your own project based on the starter project:
    - Open [generator](https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus-starter/generate)
    - Provide repository name for your test project
    - Choose option to make your repository `Public` or `Private` (`Private` is recommended from start, it can be changed in future)
1. Clone your newly generated repository:
    ```shell
    git clone --recursive your_generated_project_link.git
    ```
1. Go to the local directory with your cloned repository:
    ```shell
    cd your_repository_name
    ```
1. Create your tests

## How to use IDE for the tests development
### Eclipse
#### Prerequisites
1. Install [Eclipse IDE 2022-03](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2022-03/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers)
1. Add [JBehave plugin](https://jbehave.org/eclipse-integration.html)
#### Import the project
1. Go to the root directory of the test project
1. Generates all Eclipse configuration files:
    ```shell
    ./gradlew eclipse
    ```
1. [Import the project to Eclipse](https://help.eclipse.org/2022-03/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-importproject.htm)


## How to run the tests via CLI
1. Assuming you are in the local directory with your cloned repository run your tests via Gradle:
    ```shell
    ./gradlew runStories
    ```

## How to view the test execution results
1. At the end of any test run, VIVIDUS will give you a link to where the corresponding test result was published. It should look like this:
    ```shell
    2022-04-12 13:38:15,523 [main] INFO  org.vividus.report.allure.AllureReportGenerator - Allure report is successfully generated at /dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure/index.html
    ```
1. cd into the directory.
    ```shell
    cd /dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure
    ```
1. Start a webserver of your choice, in the example below we are using a node webserver through port 3456
    ```shell
    âœ” ~/dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure
    $ http-server -p 3456
    ```
1. Launch a browser, type `localhost:3456` into the URL. If you followed the instructions properly, you should see your report.
